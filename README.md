Explain what the code does: The code scrapes a website by using libraries in Python to find the books which have a one-star rating in the first 5 pages. 
Input: URL: http://books.toscrape.com/
Output: List of books with one-star rating in the first 5 pages of the website
I think this tutorial was really interesting and a great supplement to the first webscraping tutorial!
